Dev Services are used to build a modern apps. It aims to have feature parity or surpass a cloud provider's most popular features.

It generates a set of docker compose files and creates a git repo of dotfiles.These files will deploy selected services to a docker swarm.

This asks for some proficiency linux admin.If you get stuck, first look at the [asciinema videos](#asciinema), then look at the related documentation.

## Requisites
### [Hardware](recommended-hardware.mdx)
These are the min reqs.However, the more servers the better.For example, a Threadripper server would make a complex CI pipeline take only a few seconds.All services have been tested on just two servers.

- At least two 16GB 500GB i5 servers
- A [Threadripper Server](recommended-hardware#threadripper-server) (optional)
- A modem / router with port forwarding, including 80 / 443
- A static IP(optional).If this is not possible please see the [FAQ](../FAQ)
-Ethernet Cables

>Working Setup with three regular servers.All <code>dev-services</code> and <code>personal-services</code> are distributed amongst them. If you choose two forgo either `dev-services` or `personal-services` , then you only need two servers.

### Accounts / APIs
- [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com) dev domain. The system is designed to have two separate domains. Do not use the personal service domain. We also recommend namecheaps' privatemail service. Its reliable, cheap and most importantly you can use your domain.
-[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9739/63/api-faq) API key *(This is optional but it makes things easier. I just waited for a sale and bought 20 domains for under a buck each.)*

## Installation


### Debian
```shell
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 379CE192D401AB61
echo "deb https://deb.sway-me.xyz stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
sudo apt -qq update && sudo apt -qq install sway
```

## Configuration
### Steps
This step works on a debian [clean installs](https://www.howtoforge.com/tutorial/debian-minimal-server) with [SSH server and standard system utilities](https://www.howtoforge.com/images/debian_buster_minimal_server/big/debian-10-server-33.png) installed. **Must** be done in the  following order

1. Run the following on each consecutive worker server(replace`$N` with the next consecutive number):

    ```shell
     sway docker setup worker --number=$N
    ```

1. Lastly, Run the following on the manager server:

     ```shell
    sway docker setup manager
    ````



## Deployment

```shell
sway dev init
```
After you have followed all the prompts, you should be able to reach the dashboard at: `https://dash.$DEV_DOMAIN`

These videos are here to help.There is one for a worker and one for the manager.

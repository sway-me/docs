> Huawei GT 2 running asteroidOS

Sway watch uses a customized [asteroidOS](https://asteroidos.org) rom. Currently, asteroidOS has the best support for a few Huawei watches and is the only watch sway supports.

Currently it only supports notifications and music. Heart rate monitoring is being worked on.

:::note
This asks for some proficiency in rom installation. If you get stuck, first look at the [asciinema videos](#asciinema), then look at the related documentation.

## Installation

1. Get the sway  fastboot [here](https://minio.resistr.life/img/watch.fastboot)  and the .ext4 image [here](https://minio.sway-me.xyz/img/watch.ext4).

`keytool -list -printcert -jarfile lineage-microG.zip`
